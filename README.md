### What does this Block do for me?

**(1) Replicate Existing Shopify Reports** - easily replicate your existing Shopify reports to gain a comprehensive view of your customers and their purchase patterns.

**(2) Sophisticated Analysis** - perform sophisticated customer analysis such as cohorting, retention, customer lifetime value, period over period analysis, and more.

**(3) Enterprise Data Platform** - take advantage of Looker's data platform functionality, including data actions, scheduling, permissions, alerting, parameterization (each user can only see their own data), and more.

**(4) Usable / Shareable Dashboards** - create centralized dashboards for the entire team, and departmental or individual dashboards for each user, and rest easy knowing everyone is looking at the same information at all times. Then schedule the dashboard for emails or alerts, period-end reporting, anamoly detection, or whatever else serves your use-case.
